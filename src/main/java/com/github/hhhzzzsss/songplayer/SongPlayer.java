		Hello person looking at the source code! This is probably going to be my final build, other than bug fixes and latest version support.
		Huge thanks to LiveOverflow for motivating me to learn how to make mods and make my own bypass to his AntiHuman plugin, as well as hhhzzzsss for making the original SongPlayer

		I had fun developing this modified SongPlayer and hopefully someone can make a fork of this to further improve it later.
		I had weird suggestions that I didn't really think were useful such as playing songs in reverse. But if you want to develop that, feel free to fork this and learn a bit of java!
